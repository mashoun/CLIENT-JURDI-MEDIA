                <p>
                    In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between
                    them arising out of or concerning these Terms and Conditions, or any
                    provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or
                    in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be
                    resolved only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal
                    Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and
                    administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar
                    arbitration service selected by the parties, in a location mutually
                    agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's award shall be final, and
                    judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In
                    the event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or
                    arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms and Conditions, the

                    attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and
                    claims in regards to these Terms and Conditions or any disputes
                    arising as a result of these Terms and Conditions, whether directly or
                    indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms and

                    dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration
                    provision shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration
                    provision shall survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions.

                    Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place on an
                    individual basis; class arbitrations and
                    class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES

                    INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
                    PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS
                    IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER.
                    Further, unless both you and JURDI agree otherwise, the arbitrator may
                    not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise
                    preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

                    agreement or use of the Site. JURDI's performance of this agreement is
                    subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in
                    this agreement is in derogation of JURDI's right to comply with
                    governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements
                    relating to your use of the Site or information provided to or
                    gathered by JURDI with respect to such use. If any part of this
                    agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to
                    applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers
                    and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or
                    unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid,
                    enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the
                    original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue
                    in effect. <br /><br />
                    Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the
                    entire agreement between the user and JURDI with respect to the Site
                    and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and
                    proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the user and
                    JURDI with respect to the Site. A printed version of this agreement
                    and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in
                    judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this
                    agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as
                    other business documents and records originally generated and
                    maintained in printed form. It is the express wish to the parties that
                    this agreement and all related documents be written in English.
