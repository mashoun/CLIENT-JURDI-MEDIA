                <p>
                    Information about your computer hardware and software may be
                    automatically collected by JURDI. This information can include: your
                    IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring
                    website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the

                <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    The JURDI website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your
                    online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard
                    disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
                    deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to
                    you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued
                    the cookie to you. <br /><br />
                    One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
                    feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
                    server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
                    personalize JURDI pages, or register with JURDI site or services, a
                    cookie helps JURDI to recall your specific information on subsequent
                    visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
                    information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.
                    When you return to the same JURDI website, the information you
                    previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the JURDI
                    features that you customized.
                    <br /><br />
                    You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
                    automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
                    setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
                    cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
                    features of the JURDI services or websites you visit.
